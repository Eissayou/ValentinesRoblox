# 💕 Valentine's Roblox Game

A Roblox game I built to ask my girlfriend Kyoungmin to be my Valentine. We've been together for 2 years, but she still loves when I ask her every year — so I figured I'd make it memorable this time.

## 🎮 What It Is

An interactive experience where her dog Coco delivers the Valentine's message. Walk up to Coco, press E, and go through the dialog to get to the question. If you try to click "No", the button dodges you (and eventually gives up after 12 attempts). Click "Yes" and the whole room turns into a Gangnam Style party.

## ✨ Features

- **Valentine venue** - 100x150 stud room with pink/red decorations, floating hearts, and a red carpet
- **Coco the dog** - Her actual Shih-Poo as a 3D model (scaled 1.5x)
- **Dialog system** - Typewriter effect, click to advance through the message
- **Dodging "No" button** - Moves and shrinks each time you hover over it
- **Gangnam Style celebration** - Dancers doing the actual dance, two-track music sequence, fireworks, camera shake, post-processing effects
